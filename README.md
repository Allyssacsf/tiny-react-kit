# Tiny React Kit

The title of this repo speaks for itself. There are many frameworks out there for React, so use them.

If you like building things from scratch because you _need_ to know what you're using, then do it yourself.

And if you miraculously have the same design and architectural preferences as I do, then you have arrived at the right place.

I present to you - Tiny React Kit. The repository you can clone - viciously rename remote origin - and use as a starting point for a simple universal React app with styling and routing capabilities and easily deployable to AWS.
